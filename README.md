# React.js challenge
Your mission for this challenge is to create a navigatable UI using React.js

Clone this into a new repository and provide a new git link at least 3 hours prior to your technical interview or ideally the day before.

Use the included mockup as your reference, try to code it with the ability to easily add additional screens or modify the question order. Be sure to use global state management for keeping track of answers.

Please include unit tests and how many hours you spent on the poject.

## Notes
It was easy and simple, nothing to complex
I started by using my fav method (divide conquer) and gone with the easy componenet, and fix each one small one and gone up

Time Spent: 
Almost 3 hours
